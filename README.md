This is a strongly simplified version of Judah's code for use it on supercomputers.

Judah will have been ported to the following platforms

- OpenMP
- Nvidia CUDA
- Intel Xeon Phi coprocessor

## Genealogy of Judah

1. [Samu](https://github.com/nbatfai/samu)
The main purpose of this project is to allow the evaluation and verification of the results of the paper entitled **"A disembodied developmental robotic agent called Samu BÃ¡tfai"**. It is our hope that Samu will be the ancestor of developmental robotics chatter bots that will be able to chat in natural language like humans do.
2. [Isaac](https://github.com/nbatfai/isaac)
*"The son of Samu is Isaac."* The project called Isaac is a case study of using deep Q learning with neural networks for predicting the next sentence of a conversation.
3. [Jacob](https://github.com/nbatfai/jacob)
*"The son of Isaac is Jacob."* The project called Jacob is an experiment to replace Isaac's (GUI based) visual imagination with a character console. 
4. [Judah](https://github.com/nbatfai/judah)
*"The son of Jacob is Judah."* In the project called Judah we equip Jacob with a text-based user interface.
5. [Perez](https://github.com/nbatfai/perez)
*"The son of Judah is Perez."* The project called Perez allows to perform experiments to test several parameter settings. Here each experiment is implemented as a separate git branch.
